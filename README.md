# Preference Based Generation system

This project is a redesign of my master thesis, inspired primarily by "Preference-Based Image Generation" article. 

(Hadi Kazemi, Fariborz Taherkhani, and Nasser M. Nasrabadi. Preference-based
image generation. In 2020 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer
Vision (WACV), pages 3393â€“3402, 2020. Link: https://www.overleaf.com/project/654a7b69e4ff0a4650ea3272)

Currently it is work in progress and it has implememntation of the majority of the required components. System design is focused to work with pairwise preferences, while prioritising the ability to work with different medias.

A more detailed description of the system and its components will be added later.

# Implemented on a system:

* Windows 10
* Python 3.12
* CUDA 10.8
